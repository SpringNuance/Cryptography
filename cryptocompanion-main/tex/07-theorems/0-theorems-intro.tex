This section presents theorems about the primitives introduced in Section~\ref{section:primitives}. These should help in understanding the primitives, and expose you to useful facts about them. All of these things can be proven using the definitions and security definitions presented in this book. Some proofs are given in Section~\ref{section:proofs}.
