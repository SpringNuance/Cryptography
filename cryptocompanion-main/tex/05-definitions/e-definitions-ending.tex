\subsection*{What's next}
This section has given you all the necessary notations and definitions that you need to read the definitions of primitives in Section \ref{section:primitives}. All the tools given here are used in giving game-based security definitions of primitives. Sections \ref{section:theorems} and \ref{section:proofs} give constructions and carry out rigorous proofs, which was the reason for us needing the precision given in this section. There are some techniques used in the proofs which haven't been discussed yet; Section \ref{section:proof-writing} explains these.

This section hasn't explained the full reasoning for the modeling choices made. In addition to following the cross-links given in this section, reading Section \ref{section:foundations} should deepen your understanding by explaining the theoretical roots of the definitions.
