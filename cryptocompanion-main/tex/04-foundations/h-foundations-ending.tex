\subsection*{What's next}

This section has dealt with foundational issues in security, computation and probability. What follows are sections that work on top of these foundations to give exact, rigorous definitions of security. Section \ref{section:definitions} will give technical notation: for pseudocode, for probabilities, and for security. Section \ref{section:primitives} will then use this notation to define concrete primitives. In Section \ref{section:theorems} we will state security statements about these primitives. Some of these statements are proven in Section \ref{section:proofs}, with \ref{section:proof-writing} covering some techinques that show up often in proofs.
