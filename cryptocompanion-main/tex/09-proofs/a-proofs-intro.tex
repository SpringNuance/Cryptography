This Section goes over concrete security proofs, using all the tools of the previous sections. The proofs serve two purposes. First, they give concrete examples of doing the types of security proofs this book has been focused on. Second, they give proofs of interesting results in a uniform format that is easy to refer to.

There are no dependencies between the proofs given here, so you can go to whichever subsection interests you. When reading a proof, you might have to refer to Section \ref{section:definitions} for any unfamiliar notation and to the definitions of the relevant primitives in Section \ref{section:primitives}.
