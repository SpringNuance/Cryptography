# Companion to Cryptographic Primitives, Protocols and Proofs ([pdf](https://cryptocompanion.github.io/cryptocompanion/cryptocompanion.pdf))
This is the github repository for the book "Companion to Cryptographic Primitives, Protocols and Proofs" written by Chris Brzuska and Valtteri Lipiäinen. The book aims to provide an introduction to cryptography, with a focus on formal proving using the state-separating proofs (SSP) framework.
## State of the project
The project is not meant to be complete yet: there will likely be major changes and additions in the future. Any feedback is welcome.
## Compiling
The book is typeset with latex, so an installation of latex is necessary to compile it. Compiling the file ```main.tex``` by running e.g. ```latexmk main.tex``` should produce the current version of the book as a pdf.
## Contributing
We plan on eventually publishing this book with an open license, allowing others to use the material freely and contribute. However, we still have to figure out the licensing details. Because of this, we won't be accepting pull requests at the moment, and all rights to the book are reserved.
